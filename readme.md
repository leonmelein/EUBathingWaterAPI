_Where to safely swim in open water in Europe?_

## Data
The locations and measurements are based on data generated by European governments, in accordance to the EU Bathing Water Directive.

This data is supplemented with additional open data to give a more complete view of swimming conditions. Currently, this is only the case for The Netherlands:

* Marineterrein (Amsterdam, NL): popular swimming spot that does their own monitoring, outside of the EU BWD scope
* Amsterdecks (Amsterdam, NL): additional data on an EU BWD designated swim spot in Nieuwe Meer, Amsterdam, NL
* Meetnet Water (NL): data on water temperature for major waterways in The Netherlands

## Setup
TBD

## Tests
TBD
